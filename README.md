## INTRODUCTION

The Aqto AI Codegen module is designed to aid developers in generating site code via AI with natural language.

The primary use case for this module is:

- Rapidly build scaffolding for new modules, themes, and other code artifacts using natural language and AI integration.

## REQUIREMENTS

[Aqto AI Core](https://github.com/twfahey1/aqto_ai_core)

## INSTALLATION

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: https://www.drupal.org/node/895232 for further information.

## CONFIGURATION
- On the Aqto AI Core test page (/aqto-ai-core/test), ask the AI to generate some code for you, e.g. "Hey, I need a new module, please, lets call it 'test123'."

## USAGE
You can use natural language roughly equivalent to the following to generate code:
"Hey, I need a new module, please, lets call it 'test123'."
"In super_blocks module, lets do a Hero block that has a caption and subheading with a media image field"
